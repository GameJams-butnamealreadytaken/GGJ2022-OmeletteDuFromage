# GGJ2022-OmeletteDuFromage
DAMN DANIEL

# Introduction

Robert the farmer and Monique the mole are close neighbours, living on their side of the Robert's field.
Robert likes to listen his jazzy chill music while Monique collects crystals in the burrow.

But they are now invaded by mushrooms, it's not acceptable.

# Objective

Clean your side of the field by hitting mushrooms with your hammer.
Hit mushrooms are sent to the other side with additional life and will need extra hits.
Take care of your life and survive to win!
